# Create: Optimization
yay its my first actually useful mod

Create: Optimization "optimizes" some of the more laggy components in create. Why is optimizes in quotation marks? Well I'm too lazy to actually optimize it so I simply lower the rate at which some components tick.

## Features

- "optimized" funnels, chutes and water wheels
- due to how they are "optimized" funnels and chutes are 5x slower :(

## Why these specific blocks

- Large water wheels for some reason do 12 block updates per tick per water wheel, so if you had 100 water wheels that would be 24 thousand block updates per second, I have simply made it 12 block updates per 60 ticks (3 seconds) to divide that 24 thousand down to 400 per second!
- Funnels and chutes I have heard cause a lot of lag, I don't know why but I slowed them down to 5 ticks per tick to avoid that.

## Why did I even decide to make this

- My friend's server is laggy af even with 16 gigs of ram so yeah
